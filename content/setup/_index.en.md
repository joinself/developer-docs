### What is self?

Self is a free to use service that lets you prove you’re a real, live person and are who you say you are, all without revealing the detail of your identity. Self keeps your data safe, secure and anonymous.


### How does it work?
You download the Self mobile app for free and tell it some facts about you. Then you ask friends, family, colleagues or a recognised organisation (eg: a bank) to verify that your facts are true. Your name, age, location etc…

The facts are stored in your secret locker (personal data store) and are never shared with anyone, but when someone needs to know your age, Self can help you provide them with a verified answer, all while keeping your data safe, secure and anonymous.
