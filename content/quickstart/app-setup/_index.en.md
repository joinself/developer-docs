Now that you have logged into the Sandbox Developer Portal you are ready to create your first publisher and application.

## Create a publisher

To create a publisher you need to provide a name and an image for your publisher. These will be displayed to users of the Self Sandbox network.

The next step is to generate keys for your publisher. The generated keys will only be displayed once so please copy the keys and store them somewhere safe. 

## Create an application

After you store your publisher keys somewhere safe you can create your application. Please provide a name and an image for your application. These will be displayed to users of the Self Sandbox network.

You can also decide who can connect to you application. The default setting is `everyone` and we recommend you leave it like that, however you can restrict access to your Self ID only if you need to.

The next step is to generate keys for your application. The generated keys will only be displayed once so please copy the keys and store them somewhere safe. 

There are a number of options you can toggle on/off after you create your application:
- `List your app on the Self Directory:` This makes it easy for users to find your application. We recommend you enable this.
- `Allow your app to receive messages:` You should enable this if you want to support chat messaging with your application.
- `Allow your app to receive calls:` You should enable this if you want to support incoming voice calls with your application.

Congratulations! You are now ready to start using your [new application]({{< ref "/quickstart" >}}).
