The Self sandbox environment is a simulated space where software developers, testers, and users can experiment with code, applications and other technology projects in a controlled, isolated setting. 

This environment provides a safe place to try new things, test and debug code, and explore new ideas without affecting the live production environment.

## Benefits

Self Sandbox environment makes it simple for you to setup your developer account and start trying out your app.

First thing you should do is download [Self Sandbox](#) from your store, try out the links below.

Once you have your mobile client setup, you can go to [Sandbox Developer Portal](#) and create your first app. You'll notice we've reduced the requirements to get started with Self on this environment.

You can refer to {{< relref "quickstart/app-setup" >}} for more information on the configuration options you have for your app.


## Limitations

To keep things under control we purge the data from this environment from time to time. This doesn't mean you'll be losing all your data within a week, but it will happen eventually.
