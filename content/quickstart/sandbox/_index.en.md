The Self sandbox environment is a simulated space where software developers, testers, and users can experiment with code, applications and other technology projects in a controlled, isolated setting. 

This environment provides a safe place to try new things, test and debug code, and explore new ideas without affecting the live production environment.

Once you have your mobile client setup, you can go to [Sandbox Developer Portal](https://developer.sandbox.joinself.com/) and create your first app. You'll notice we've reduced the requirements to get started with Self on this environment.

You can refer to [app-setup section]({{< ref "/quickstart/app-setup" >}}) for more information on the configuration options you have for your app.


## Benefits

Self Sandbox environment makes it simple for you to setup your developer account and start trying out your app.

## Limitations

To keep things under control we purge the data from this environment from time to time. This doesn't mean you'll be losing all your data within a week, but it will happen eventually.
