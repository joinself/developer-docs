The Self Sandbox environment is a space where software developers and users can experiment with code and applications in an isolated setting with access to all the features of Self. 

This environment provides a safe place to try new things, test and debug code, and explore new ideas without affecting the live production environment.

## Login to the Sandbox Developer Portal

Now you can go to the <a href="https://developer.sandbox.joinself.com/" target="_blank">Sandbox Developer Portal</a> and login. Once you are logged in you can create your first publisher and then your first application.

You can refer to [App setup section]({{< ref "/quickstart/app-setup" >}}) for more information on the configuration options you have for publishers and applications.

## Limitations

The Self Sandbox environment is for testing, and is not suitable for production use. The Sandbox environment provides reduced perfomance and resiliency, and we periodically purge the data.
