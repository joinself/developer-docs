In contrast to blocking auth requests, there are situations where you just want to continue your execution line and set up an observer to be executed as soon as a response is received.

Let's say you have a conventional registration process where you let your users register to your application by its email address but you delay the email confirmation until they get back to you. This allows your users to go through a quick registration process, while you delay the data confirmation process.
