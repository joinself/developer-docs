An easy to use zero knowledge fact checker allows developers to ask the questions they really need an answer to, and receive anonymised answers.

That means they need to worry less about running a secure compliant environment.

### How do they work?

Intermediary fact checks are useful when you want to run a check of a user’s verified fact without having to gain access to that fact.

Eg. You want to verify a user is over 18, but you don’t want to deal with their personal information. An intermediary fact check allows you to run a zero knowledge check on that information via a **trusted intermediary**.

This is useful both for you and your users because you can prove a fact without ever directly interacting to them.
