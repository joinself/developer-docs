Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. 

It usually involves the presentation of credentials (such as username and password), which are then checked against an authentication database to ensure that the user is who they claim to be. 

Self authentication system allows you to build a biometric authentication system without effort, avoiding passwords or codes, and allowing you to verify you're logging in the right person straight from its phone.

{{< notice note >}}By default authentication requests will expire after 5 minutes, you can change this defaults with `Expiry` option.{{</ notice >}}
