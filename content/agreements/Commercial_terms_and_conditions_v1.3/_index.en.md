You and Self agree as follows:			


### 1.1 Your use of Self

These terms and conditions set out the basis upon which we are providing the Network for use by you as a Commercial User. They shall be deemed to include any additional terms and conditions referred to herein or provided by us from time to time unless explicitly excluded. 

For the purposes of these terms and conditions, references to “the **Network**” shall also be deemed to include reference to services and documentation provided by us through the Network, including but not limited to the Self Network, the Developer Portal, Open Source tools and software (separately licenced) and the Self App and Embedded Self App. 


### 1.2 Eligibility.

Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organisations located in one of the list of countries provided on the country list posted on our website at [https://docs.joinself.com/agreements/Country_Availability/](https://docs.joinself.com/agreements/Country_Availability/) are eligible to apply for a Self Organisation Account and use the Services. These commercial terms and conditions only apply to the use of Self eligible Commercial Users. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, references to “**Organisation**” will cover all types of Commercial User. 

1.3 Business Representative.					

You and your **“Representative”** (the Individual Self User submitting the application for a Self Organisation Account) individually affirm to Self that (a) your Representative is authorised to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (b) your Representative is an executive officer, director, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business. Self may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority.					


### 1.4 Sole Proprietors.					

If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.

If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorised officer. The approving board, authorised officer, parent or legal guardian is responsible to Self and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to this Agreement itself. You must not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age. Self is currently only intended for people who can legally consent to their data being processed.
