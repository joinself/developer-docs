Welcome To The Self Network. Thank you for downloading Self.
Before using Self and becoming a Member you need to ensure that you meet the Self age requirement and agree to these terms and conditions (explained in more detail in the “Your use of Self” section below), including any updates, so please read them carefully.
So, what is Self? “Self” consists of the “App” (which you have just downloaded) and a “Network” across which “Members” (you and other users of the App) can share verified information securely. The App gives you access to the Network and lets you verify, share and control the use of the personal data “Facts” you store in it. The App lets you use Facts about yourself to make your everyday interactions with people and businesses you trust easier and safer.
As well as using Self to protect your data and your rights to privacy; you can use the App to replace logins, account numbers and other identifying information with third parties who support Self, including businesses and other organisations.
Your Membership is unique to you and the data you store in Self exists only on your phone under your control unless you choose to share it (this includes when you allow the App and data to be backed up to your phone’s cloud backup). It is never shared with or visible to us other than with your explicit consent and under your control as set out below.
When you do share data, you determine who it is shared with.
Sharing data through Self is free to you as an individual user; we will however charge businesses and organisations for requesting data from you or for checking your Membership. In the future we may release new features, which may carry a charge, but these will always be optional.
You are contracting with Self Group Limited, a company registered in England with number 11855548 known as the “Company” and whose address is at Harwood House, 43 Harwood Road, London SW6 4QP. References to “we”, “us” and “our” in these terms and conditions shall be to the Company.
2. Your use of Self These terms and conditions set out the basis upon which we are providing the App and the Network for use by you. They shall be deemed to include any additional terms and conditions referred to herein or provided by us from time to time. For the purposes of these terms and conditions, references to Self and/or the App and/or the Network shall also be deemed to include reference to services and documentation provided by us through the App and/or the Network.
By using the App and becoming a Member of Self, you agree that you meet the Self age requirement (as outlined below) and agree to these terms and conditions as updated from time to time so please read them carefully first. We may need to change these terms and conditions (including any additional terms and conditions referred to herein or provided by us) from time to time. We will notify you of any such changes in the App in which case please check these terms and conditions to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply at that time. If you do not agree to the notified changes you will not be permitted to continue to use the App.
Self is currently only intended for people who can legally consent to their data being processed. Typically this means being over the age of 13. By agreeing to these terms and conditions you are promising to us that you have the ability to consent by yourself to our processing of your data. If the age of consent for data processing under the local law that applies to you means that you cannot consent then you should not use the App or join Self.
These Consumer terms and conditions apply to the use of Self by individual users for personal purposes only. If you want to use Self as a business or other organisation you will need to set up a business account and agree to our commercial terms and conditions.
3. Joining Self Once you have installed the App it will take you through becoming a Self Member. You will be asked to capture some data from your passport using the App, and provide some information we can confirm like a phone number and email address to enable you to find people you know in Self. You also need to accept the app requirements for using features of your phone, including but not limited to: the camera (for biometrics), the microphone (for calling), notifications (so you get important messages, or know when someone contacts you), Contacts (so the App can help you find people you know in Self), Backup (so you don’t lose your Self account if your phone is lost or damaged).
The App needs this access because the App is taking advantage of the uniqueness of the things you do to secure your account. The App is a tool that lets you check yourself, so it needs access to things like your location and notifications to be sure that your account is safe. Please enable any services the App needs in order to function. The App is not and never will be gathering data about you to share with anyone else including the Company. The App is only acting on your behalf. And make sure backup is on. Without a backup you cannot recover an account.
4. Using Self The Network is designed to allow you trusted access to services and systems provided by businesses and organisations who have chosen to support Self as a means of connecting to their customers. It also allows you to create a community of people who you trust with whom you are happy to share information.
Through the Network, Members can be sure you are real, they can be sure you are the right Member and they can be sure of key facts about you, like are you over 18, all without you having to share those facts or reveal who you are.
Your App also allows you to share specific facts about yourself, like your name or date of birth, with people and organisations you are connected to.
The App may not work with all phones; you are responsible for ensuring that you have a phone that works with the App.
We may change our security requirements from time to time. All instructions given in the App, including as regards access to the App and security, also form part of these terms and conditions.
5. Using the App to store and verify Data Once you have joined the Self Network and logged in to the App there will be a tab marked Profile. This is for you to use to store Facts about yourself. Facts you added to Self during sign up will be displayed there and if they have been verified as being true by an authoritative third party they will be marked with a ticked shield.
The Facts only exist in your App (and in any location you choose to back them up to); they are verified bits of personal data which another Member has confirmed are true. You can add Facts to the App and ask Members you are connected to (both organisations and individuals) to verify those Facts are true.
You can add additional Facts about yourself and ask for them to be verified. This might include e-mail or physical addresses, your full name, details of your employer or the details from an official document like a passport or driving licence.
Companies you are connected to can ask to create bespoke Facts in your App which relate to their relationship to you so that they can vouch for information about you which you can then share, or so they can provide better service to you. All Facts stored in your App belong to you and you are then in control of sharing them even if they were created by a third party.
Through the App you can share Facts about yourself with Members you are connected to. Even though you have chosen to be connected to another Member, you should be careful about the Facts that you share and the purpose that you are sharing them for. Your Facts are valuable and you should avoid giving them away without a good reason.
When you share a Fact it is shared with a contract that defines how long the recipient has access to your Fact for. We strongly encourage recipients not to store the Facts they receive through Self. The recipient will normally be limited to using the Fact only once and to destroying their copy of that Fact within a given timeframe, typically when they have completed the purpose. They may also ask to have access repeatedly over a period of time to allow them to complete some work without taking on the risk of storing your personally identifiable data locally. The App contains a list of the Members you are connected to and the Facts you have shared with each one. The App also lets you check and manage all your sharing.
Once you have shared a Fact with another Member, Self has no control over what they are able to do with that Fact. you should treat all Fact sharing as though the recipient is going to be keeping the Fact forever.
6. App Recovery Self uses your biometric to get you access to your account again if for any reason you lose it. You’ll be asked to complete the familiar selfie process once your backup has been located, and then you’ll get access to your account again. Currently we cannot support cross platform restores or allow you to move a Self account between iOS and Android devices.
7. Biometrics and PIN You can choose to access the App using a device biometric check like a fingerprint or face scan. If you choose to enable device biometrics you will also be asked to create a 6 digit PIN for accessing the App in emergency. You must make sure no one else has access to your PIN, so it stays safe and private.
8. Encryption and Data Backup All data stored in your App will be encrypted on your mobile in the App. Any data being shared is encrypted end-to-end. Backups of your data and Membership details will be stored encrypted in the cloud drive nominated by you during the joining process. It is your responsibility to keep your phone, login details and recovery details safe, and to prevent others from having unauthorised access to your Membership details.
9. It is all about data privacy Your data belongs to you. We believe it is safer for people and better for businesses for you to control your data. Self enables you to allow others to use your personal data only for specific reasons and you remain in control of that.
Current Regulations, such as GDPR are a good start, but we think they don&rsquo;t go far enough. No company needs to keep your data, especially if they use Self.
We believe in only holding data we have to hold*, and being clear as to the specific purpose of holding that data. Our privacy policy governs what personal information of yours we hold, why we hold it and how we use it. It forms part of these terms and conditions so please read it at https://www.joinself.com/app-privacy-policy
_*We would hold no personal data at all if we could get away with it. _
10. Your obligations when using Self You agree to ensure that any and all information and material which you share through the App is accurate (where it states facts); is genuinely held (where it states opinions) and complies with the law applicable in England and Wales and in any country from which it is posted.
You must consider very carefully before sharing any information or material with a third party through the App. You acknowledge that we have no control over what the third party may do with any such information or material and accordingly we accept no liability for the use of your information by any third party. Members who misuse data they have had shared with them in good faith may be sanctioned which might include financial penalties or Membership termination. You must not and agree not to:
use the App in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these terms and conditions, or act fraudulently or maliciously or in a way likely to deceive any person; use forged or improperly obtained documentation; impersonate any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person; give the impression that the information or material emanates from any person other than yourself, if this is not the case; infringe our intellectual property rights or those of any third party in relation to your use of the App, including by the submission of any information or material (to the extent that such use is not licensed by these terms); transmit any material that is defamatory, offensive or otherwise objectionable in relation to your use of the App; use the App in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users; collect or harvest any information or data from the App or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the App; except in the course of permitted sharing as envisaged by the normal use of the App: rent, lease, sub-license, loan, provide, or otherwise make available, the App in any form, in whole or in part to any person without prior written consent from us; copy the App, except as part of the normal use of the App or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security; translate, merge, adapt, vary, alter or modify, the whole or any part of the App, nor permit the App to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs, except as necessary to use the App on devices as permitted in these terms; disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the App or the Services nor attempt to do any such things. 11. Accuracy of information and opinions Self provides a means for Members to share information with other Members. While Self is designed in a way to seek to ensure that information provided by Members is accurate and verifiable, we make no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability.
Any opinion given by Self regarding the strength of a Member’s account is just an opinion and does not constitute a representation or warranty regarding such Member or the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability of any information that he or she provides.
Accordingly, any reliance you place on any information supplied by a Member or any opinion given by Self regarding the Member and/or the strength or his or her account is strictly at your own risk and no liability is accepted by us in respect thereof.
12. Intellectual property We licence you to use the App for your personal use and not (unless you have set up a business account and agreed to our business terms and conditions or unless we have otherwise agreed in writing) for any business purposes.
All intellectual property rights in the App belong to us and the rights in the App are licensed (not sold) to you. You have no intellectual property rights in, or to, the App, the Network, the documentation or the services other than the right to use them in accordance with these terms.
13. Updates to the App From time to time we may automatically update the App to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively we may ask you to update the App for these reasons. If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App. To get the best out of the App, you should always use the most recent version and download any updates we make available. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage you may suffer by continuing to use an outdated version of the App.
14. Service Availability Self is designed to be reliable and available, and we aim to ensure you are able to access the App at all times, but your use of the App may be interrupted or delayed from time to time by updates to or maintenance of the App or our systems, by failures of third party systems, or by other events outside of our control. As a result we cannot guarantee that Self will always be available. If our provision of the App is interrupted or delayed then we will endeavour to contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the interruption or delay, but we will not be liable under any circumstances for any loss or damage arising from a service interruption or delay. We may at our absolute discretion at any time and without telling you first decide to update, change or terminate the App or its availability to you and we shall not be liable to you in respect of any losses you might suffer as a result.
15. Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you Save where it is unlawful for us to limit our liability to you and subject to the remaining provisions of this section, our total liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), for breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with your use of the App or our breach of these terms and conditions shall be limited to an aggregate amount of £10).
We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
We are only responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms and conditions or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these terms and conditions, both we and you knew it might happen.
If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.
We are not liable to you for any business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity
We are not liable to you for any loss or damage you may suffer due to the actions of any third parties nor are we liable where any loss or damage you may suffer has been caused by your breach of these terms and conditions. Please also refer to the underlined parts of sections 10, 11, 13 and 14 above and 17 and 18 below.
16. If you no longer want a Self Membership You can delete the App and your account at any time by choosing “delete account” from the Settings menu. Doing so will remove all your data from your phone and from backups. Once your App has been deleted, your account and your data will no longer be available or recoverable.
17. Termination &amp; Suspension You must comply with these terms and conditions. If you fail to do so we may at our absolute discretion suspend or terminate your account and access to the App without responsibility or liability to you.
We may decide to cease providing some or all of the services through the App. We will endeavour to give you reasonable notice through the App of a service change. You will lose the right to use the discontinued service, at a time advised to you, decided at our discretion and without responsibility to you.
18. Third party service providers We work with third parties to deliver our services to you. Because they are essential to our business, your agreement to these terms and conditions includes an agreement to our right to transfer, assign, subcontract or deal in any other manner with our rights and obligations under these terms and conditions. However that will never include exposing your data to them which will always remain under your sole control.
Before using the App to share Facts with any third party service provider, even one working with us, you should check to ensure that they are legitimate. We give no guarantee as to any business or organisation which uses our service. You should also review their terms and conditions and ensure that you comply with any requirements contained in them and agree with them. We have no control over third parties or their services and accept no responsibility for them nor for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them nor for any refusal by such third parties to provide you with products or services.
19. General legal points We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.
This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.
Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
These terms are governed by English law and we must each bring legal proceedings in respect of the App (whether contractual or non-contractual) in the English courts.
If you have a complaint regarding the service, please contact us at support@joinself.zendesk.com and try to resolve it informally. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint, you may wish to consider alternative dispute resolution which is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. Disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform.

How does it work? You download the Self mobile app for free and and use it to verify and store claims about yourself.
The facts are stored in your wallet and are never shared without your explicit permission.
</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/setup/"},{value:"Connections",label:`<p>Permit connections Allows incoming messages from specified identities.
@client.messaging.permit_connection &quot;1234567890&quot; err := selfsdk.MessagingService().PermitConnection(&quot;1234567890&quot;) let success = await sdk.messaging().permitConnection(&quot;1234567890&quot;) Permitting incomming connections only applies if you don&rsquo;t have a global connection (*) permission. If you do, you have to revoke it first.
Permit global connections You can permit connections from everyone using an “*”.
@client.messaging.permit_connection &quot;*&quot; err := selfsdk.MessagingService().PermitConnection(&quot;*&quot;) let success = await sdk.messaging().permitConnection(&quot;*&quot;) Revoke specific connection You can also revoke connections from a specific self identifier with:

On this example we will know in advance the user Self Identifier, you&rsquo;ll need to allow the user introduce its ID on your application so you can proceed with this request.
Note that by default users won&rsquo;t be connected to your app, in those cases they won&rsquo;t be receiving any incoming request, so let them know they need to be connected in advance.
Blocking request Let&rsquo;s see an easy example on how to implement an authentication workflow with the different Self SDKs.
On this example we will opt for a blocking approach, where the main execution line waits for the user response to continue.
user = &quot;1112223334&quot; authenticated = @app.authentication.request(user).accepted? user := &quot;1112223334&quot; if resp, err != client.AuthenticationService().Request(user); err != nil { println(&quot;authentication rejected&quot;) return } authenticated := resp.Accepted let res = await client.authentication().request(&quot;1112223334&quot;) let authenticated = res.isAccepted() The user will receive
Non-blocking request In contrast to blocking auth requests, there are situations where you just want to continue your execution line and set up an observer to be executed as soon as a response is received.
Let&rsquo;s say you have a conventional registration process where you let your users register to your application by its email address but you delay the email confirmation until they get back to you. This allows your users to go through a quick registration process, while you delay the data confirmation process.
# Request lets you pass a block to be executed once a response is received @client.authentication.request selfid do |auth| return auth.accepted? # The user has rejected the authentication end // Go language provides you with goroutines to // implement a non-blocking approach go func() { res, err != client.AuthenticationService().Request(selfid) if err != nil { println(&quot;authentication rejected&quot;) return } println(res.Accepted) }() async() =&gt; { try { let res = await client.authentication().request(&quot;1112223334&quot;) if(res.isAccepted() == true) { client.logger.info(`\${res.selfID} is now authenticated 🤘`) } else if(res.accepted == false) { client.logger.warn(`\${res.selfID} has rejected your authentication request`) } else { client.logger.error(res.errorMessage) } } catch (error) { client.logger.error(error.toString()) } } Asynchronous requests This scenario is similar to non-blocking authentication, however, it’s not restricted to only one user.
Sending an asynchronous authentication request is pretty straightforward, you can do it with the async option.
This will return a conversation id identifying the authentication conversation, you should store it and catch it on a subscription, check Receiving authentication response - Subscribe section on how to manage this.
cid = @client. authentication. request(&quot;1112223334&quot;, async: true) client. AuthenticationService(). RequestAsync(&quot;1112223334&quot;, &quot;conversation_id&quot;) let res = await client. authentication(). request(&quot;1112223334&quot;, { 'async': true }) As you can see the asynchronously of this call is accomplished by an extra option or modifier Let&rsquo;s see on the next chapter what other modifiers provides the authentication workflow.
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/authentication/request/"},{value:"Request",label:`<p>Blocking Same as with authentication there are situations where you want to block your execution line until the user responds to your fact request. For example, you may want to block a user&rsquo;s access to a certain space of your site until you verify its passport number.
This function blocks the execution line until the user responds with its verified email address.
def get_email(selfid) res = @client.facts.request(selfid, [:email_address]) return &quot;&quot; unless res.accepted? res.attestation_values_for(:email_address).first // Refer to Receiving fact response - Deal with request for more info rescue =&gt; e // An exception will be raised in case of a timeout or internal error return &quot;&quot; end resp, err := client.FactService().Request(&amp;fact.FactRequest{ SelfID: selfID, Description: &quot;info&quot;, Facts: []fact.Fact{{ Fact: fact.FactEmail }}, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, }) if err != nil { return &quot;&quot;, err } aa, err := resp.AttestationValuesFor(fact.FactEmail) if err != nil { return &quot;&quot;, err } println(aa[0]) try { let res = await sdk.facts().request(selfID, [{ fact: 'email_address' }]) if (!res) { sdk.logger.warn(`fact request has timed out`) } else if (res.status === 'accepted') { let pn = res.attestationValuesFor('email_address')[0] sdk.logger.info(`\${selfID} email address is &quot;\${pn}&quot;`) } else { sdk.logger.warn(`\${selfID} has rejected your authentication request`) } } catch (error) { sdk.logger.error(error.toString()) } Non-blocking The sdk also allows us to send a fact request without blocking the execution line.
Same registration example we used for authentication works here, if you want to get a user verified fact but you don’t want the user to be blocked on the registration form, you can use this approach to continue with the execution line, and process the response as soon as it gets back.
Let’s see how we can request a verified email address with a non-blocking request.
def get_email_in_background(selfid) @client.facts.request(user, [:email_address]) do |res| return &quot;&quot; unless res.accepted? return res.attestation_values_for(:email_address).first # Refer to Receiving fact response - Deal with request for more info end rescue =&gt; e # An exception will be raised in case of a timeout or internal error return &quot;&quot; end // Use goroutines to manage this scenario // Use async() = {} to manage this scenario Asynchronous The asynchronous approach can be used in scenarios like the previous one, however it has a subtle difference, you have a single observer for all information requests, which can be useful in some situations as you can have all the logic centralized on a single point.
cid = @client.facts.request(selfid, [SelfSDK::FACT_EMAIL], async: true) resp, err := client.FactService().RequestAsync(&amp;fact.FactRequestAsync{ SelfID: selfID, Description: &quot;info&quot;, Facts: []fact.Fact{{ Fact: fact.FactEmail }}, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, CID: &quot;conversation_id&quot;, }) let res = await sdk.facts().request(selfID, [{ fact: 'email_address' }], { async: true }) </p><p></p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/facts/request/"},{value:"Sandbox",label:`<p>The Self Sandbox environment is a space where software developers and users can experiment with code and applications in an isolated setting with access to all the features of Self.

The interface used to interact with messaging is chat service, let&rsquo;s see how can we create an app automatically responding all ping messages with a pong.
@app.chat.on_message do |msg| if msg.body == &quot;ping msg.message &quot;pong&quot; end end @app.chat.message user, &quot;ready!&quot; client.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { if cm.Body == &quot;ping&quot; { cm.Message(&quot;pong&quot;) } }) @app.chat.message user, &quot;ready!&quot; sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { if (cm.body == &quot;ping&quot;) { cm.message(&quot;pong&quot;) } }) @app.chat.message user, &quot;ready!&quot; Easy, isn&rsquo;t it? As you can see, you can use the chat service message method to send messages to a specific user, and on_message to receive them.
The object representing a message has also some handy methods to interact with that message, included sending a new message to the same conversation with message(body).
Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at all the options you have when sending and receiving messages
Sending messages The interface for sending a normal message is quite simple, just provide the user and text you want to send and that&rsquo;s it.
However, the system provides some useful options you can pass to this method. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the most important ones.
@app.chat.message user, &quot;ready!&quot;, gid: &quot;group_id&quot;, rid: &quot;uuid&quot;, client.ChatService().Message(user, &quot;ready!&quot;, chat.MessageOptions{ GID: &quot;group_id&quot;, RID: &quot;uuid&quot;, }) client.chat().message user, &quot;ready!&quot;, { &quot;gid&quot;: &quot;group_id&quot;, &quot;rid&quot;: &quot;uuid&quot; } gid You&rsquo;ll see gid option supported across different methods, gid refers to group id, and when provided will indicate the other client the current conversation is a group conversation instead of a 1 to 1 chat.
Usually this id is not used directly through this method, and instead the message is sent through a helper on Group object, check Groups for more details.
rid In this case rid is used to refer a previous message by it&rsquo;s jti, once the other party receives a rid as part of the payload it will interpret is a direct response to a specific message, and it will be displayed accordingly.
If you&rsquo;ve already received a message you want to respond, you can do it directly through the respond method like:
@app.chat.on_message do |msg| msg.respond &quot;I like this&quot; end client.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { cm.Respond(&quot;I like this&quot;) }) sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { cm.respond(&quot;I like this&quot;) }) </p><p>messaging</p><p>message</p><p>messages</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/messaging/text-messages/"},{value:"Commercial Terms and Conditions v1.3",label:`<p>These Self Commercial Terms and Conditions includes this introduction, the General Terms, Definitions, Services Terms, and incorporated documents and terms (“Agreement”) and forms a legal agreement between Self Group Limited (“Self”)and the entity or sole proprietor on whose behalf a Self Organisation Account is created (“you” and “your”) This Agreement states the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.

Create a publisher To create a publisher you need to provide a name and an image for your publisher. These will be displayed to users of the Self Sandbox network.
The next step is to generate keys for your publisher. The generated keys will only be displayed once so please copy the keys and store them somewhere safe.
Create an application After you store your publisher keys somewhere safe you can create your application. Please provide a name and an image for your application. These will be displayed to users of the Self Sandbox network.
You can also decide who can connect to you application. The default setting is everyone and we recommend you leave it like that, however you can restrict access to your Self ID only if you need to.
The next step is to generate keys for your application. The generated keys will only be displayed once so please copy the keys and store them somewhere safe.
There are a number of options you can toggle on/off after you create your application:
List your app on the Self Directory: This makes it easy for users to find your application. We recommend you enable this. Allow your app to receive messages: You should enable this if you want to support chat messaging with your application. Allow your app to receive calls: You should enable this if you want to support incoming voice calls with your application. Congratulations! You are now ready to start using your new application.
</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/quickstart/app-setup/"},{value:"Connections",label:`<p>This feature allows you to manage your connections by permitting and revoking incoming messages from specific identities.
During the app creation process you can define if your app permits connections from everyone, or just you. You can tweak this behaviour as shown below.

Please visit the official app stores to download our official apps for Android and iOS
Create an account Visit Self Developer Portal and follow the steps to register. You&rsquo;ll need a Self Identifier account to proceed.
App creation Self-apps are autonomous self identities able to interact with other identities on the Self-network.
A developer can create an app through the developer portal. This app will be identified by a SELF_APP_ID and a SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET.
SELF_APP_ID is your public identifier on the network and you can share it with other peers. You must keep SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET in a secure place.
You’ll see below how to use these two strings to initialize your client and start interacting with the Self-network.
Remember — copy and store SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET, as we don&rsquo;t have access to it.
Environments Self provides a sandbox so you can try your app code before moving to production. You can register for a free developer account and create new test apps on the Sandbox developer portal here.
Once your app is ready you can create a new one on production here

We name these entities identities and they own a self_id, an array of device ids and an array of public keys.
An identity can only communicate with another identity if IdentityA is a connection of IdentityB. If this connection is in place IdentityA will be able to request the IdentityB properties (device_ids and public keys) to interact with it.
At the moment identities can be divided into users and apps.
Getting the public keys Every single identity on the Self network has at least one public key assigned to it. Lets see how you can get the public keys related to a Self user.

Mark as received When your app receives a message the sdk is marking it as received by default. This behavior can be changed by modifying passing a specific parameter to on_message, at the same time you can mark a message as read on your convenience, let&rsquo;s see how.
@app.chat.on_message mark_as_delivered: false do |msg| msg.mark_as_delivered # explicitly mark the message as delivered end client.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { cm.MarkAsDelivered() }, chat.OnMessageOptions{ MarkAsDelivered: false }) sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { cm.markAsDelivered() }, { 'mark_as_delivered': false }) Default behavior for on_message is to mark the message as received as soon as it&rsquo;s received.
Mark as read Similarly to the previous example, you can modify on_message to automatically mark all messages as read with a specific option.
@app.chat.on_message mark_as_read: true do |msg| # ... end client.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { // ... }, chat.OnMessageOptions{ MarkAsRead: true }) sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { // ... }, { 'mark_as_read': true }) Additionally you can explicitly mark a received message as read with your own logic.
@app.chat.on_message do |msg| msg.mark_as_read end client.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { cm.MarkAsRead() }) sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { cm.MarkAsRead() }) Edit For a message you&rsquo;ve already sent you can modify its body.
m = @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.edit &quot;two&quot; m := @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.Edit(&quot;two&quot;) let m = @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.Edit(&quot;two&quot;) You&rsquo;re only allowed to modify your own messages.
Delete Deleting a message is as simple as modifying it, but using delete method instead.
m = @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.delete m := @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.Delete() let m = @app.chat.message user, &quot;one&quot; m.Delete() You&rsquo;re only allowed to delete your own messages.

1. It is all about data privacy Your data belongs to you. We believe it is safer for people and better for businesses for you to control your data. Self enables you to allow others to use your personal data only for specific reasons and you remain in control of that.
Current Regulations, such as GDPR are a good start, but we think they don&rsquo;t go far enough. No company needs to keep your data, especially if they use Self. We believe in only holding data we have to hold*, and being clear as to the specific purpose of holding that data. Our privacy policy governs what personal information of yours we hold, why we hold it and how we use it.
We would hold no personal data at all if we could get away with it.
2. So, What is Self? Self consists of the “App” (which you have just downloaded) and a “Network” across which “Members” (you and other users of the App) can share verified information securely. The App gives you access to the Network and lets you verify, share and control the use of the personal data “Facts” you store in it. The App lets you use Facts about yourself to make your everyday interactions with people and businesses you trust easier and safer.
As well as using Self to protect your data and your rights to privacy; you can use the App to replace logins, account numbers and other identifying information with third parties who support Self, including businesses and other organisations.
Your Membership is unique to you and the data you store in Self exists only on your phone under your control unless you choose to share it. It is never shared with or visible to us other than with your explicit consent and under your control as set out below. When you do share data, you determine who it is shared with.
Sharing data through Self is free to you as an individual user; we will however charge businesses and organisations for requesting data from you or for checking your Membership. In the future we may release new features, which may carry a charge, but these will always be optional. This privacy notice explains how your data is used inside the Self App and in the limited cases where it is used or stored by Self Group, how your data is used and protected.
3. Joining Self Once you have installed the App it will take you through becoming a Self Member. You will be asked to provide some verifiable information like a phone number and taken through setting up backup and account recovery processes. These are crucial to your being able to use Self safely, without them you cannot recover an account.
The App lets you take advantage of the uniqueness of the things you do to secure your account. It is a tool that lets you check yourself, so the App needs access to things like your location and notifications to be sure that your account is safe. For the best experience, Please read the reasons for any permission requests the app makes in order to function.
4. Data Collection and Use We enable you to verify personal information which you can then share from the Self App on your phone. To do this we have to collect some information which we store temporarily during verification and two pieces of information which we keep permanently (or until you replace them); your email and your mobile phone number. We do this for several reasons:
To check if you already have an account. To create your account To verify that a document you add to your account is yours. To check you are the correct living, specific person. For authentication. To be able to contact you outside of Self in case of problems with Self or your account. 5. What Data Do We Collect? A Photo of you. We capture an image of you during the registration process. This image is stored on your phone encrypted with keys only you hold.
The image is taken from Video captured to confirm you are a real, live human. During the recording of the video you will be asked to perform various actions. Once the liveness check has been passed the image is captured and the video is deleted. The image we capture is encrypted and kept on your device in the App. When you need to biometrically verify yourself - for example during a login - the image is used to compare you with an image captured from your passport to verify you are both who you say you are and the person the account being accessed was given to. This comparison is done by sending the images to an external service where they are stored only while they are being processed and then deleted. The image is never shared with a third party except during the automated process of verification. The image is never linked to any other personal data. You keep this image on your phone until you delete your account. Further photos of you. Every time you use the Self App to verify your identity you capture another photograph. These images are all stored in the app in encrypted form until your account is deleted. Apart from during the verification process for which they were created, they cannot be shared. Over time these images will be used to train an on-device model which can be used to recognise you. This will remove the need for sending images to an external service for comparison.
Your email address. We capture your email address, if you ask us to verify it, so that we have a means of communication with you outside of Self should it be necessary. This will only be used for support purposes where Self cannot be used. In hashed form your email address(es) are also used by you for discovery of other people who you know in Self. Existing Self users who hold each other&rsquo;s contact details in their device address books and who permit access to their contacts are able to see each other as Self users.
Your mobile phone number. Your phone number is used to check you do not already have an account as multiple accounts in Self are not allowed or necessary. The number is stored as a hash and cannot be used to contact you, nor can it be shared. In hashed form your phone number is also used by you for discovery of other people who you know in Self. Existing Self users who hold each other&rsquo;s contact details in their device address books and who permit access to their contacts are able to see each other as Self users.
6. Data Location and Security The personal data we hold is stored securely in data centres in the UK. All data is encrypted. We hold no personal information other than that stated in Section 5.
7. Your Rights Self holds only two pieces of personally identifiable data on any user. you have the right to correct, delete and restrict us from using the data we hold all of which you can do from within your Self App.
8. Using the Self App to store and verify Data Once you have joined the Self Network and logged in to the App there will be a section marked Profile. This is for you to use to store Facts about yourself. Facts you added to Self during sign up will be displayed there and if they have been verified as being true by an authoritative third party they will be marked with a ticked shield.
The Facts only exist in your App (and in your encrypted device backup in iCloud or Google Cloud); they are verified bits of personal data which another Member has confirmed are true. You can add Facts to the App and ask Members you are connected to (both organisations and individuals) to verify those Facts are true. Organisations you are connected to can add custom fields to your profile to share relationship specific Facts to - like Account numbers and preferences.
You can add additional Facts about yourself and ask for them to be verified. This might include e-mail or physical addresses, your full name, details of your employer or the details from an official document like a passport or driving licence. Through the App you can share Facts about yourself with Members you are connected to. Even though you have chosen to be connected to another Member, you should be careful about the Facts that you share and the purpose that you are sharing them for. Your Facts are valuable and you should avoid giving them away without a good reason.
Requestors can ask to have access to a fact for a defined period of time if they are doing something that requires repeated access to the fact. This saves them storing your data while ensuring they have access to it if it is needed. You can revoke this access at any time.
The App contains a list of the Members you are connected to and the Facts you have shared with each one. The App also lets you check and manage all your sharing. We do not have access to any of the facts you store in your Self App other than those set out in Section 5.
9. App Recovery As part of joining Self, we will provide you with a recovery key. You will need the recovery key if you ever lose access to the App for any reason (including if you lose the phone or other device containing your Self ID), so it is very important that you make a copy of this key and store it safely and securely and not on your phone.
10. Biometrics and PIN You should only access the App using a device-based biometric check like a fingerprint or face scan. You will also be asked to create a 6 digit PIN for accessing the App in emergency, but it will only give you access to limited functionality. You must make sure no one else has access to your PIN, so it stays safe and private. The pin can be changed in settings, but you may be required to perform a biometric check to make the change. In addition to the Biometric checks done by the device, the App may use image capture and verification as set out in Section 5 to determine if the Member accessing the App is the correct Member.
11. Which Biometrics does the App Use? Facial. The images we capture of your face allow us to determine if the person using the App is the correct person. Some actions you want to take while using the app will require you to take a photo and liveness check to confirm you match the biometrics taken when you set up the account. Liveness. We use a range of technologies to check that the person claiming to be you is not an imposter, this could be using video, AI or other background information. These checks are done on the phone and are automated. Self Group has no access to the checks or their output, they are designed for you to use in your Self App to strengthen your ID security. 12. Encryption and Data Backup All data stored in your App will be encrypted on your mobile in the App. Any data being shared is encrypted end-to-end. Backups of your data and membership details will be stored encrypted in the cloud drive nominated by you during the joining process. It is your responsibility to keep your phone, login details and recovery details safe, and to prevent others from having unauthorised access to your membership details.
13. Data that helps us fix problems you experience We use Crashlytics which sends us information automatically if the app has problems or crashes. None of the information they gather allows us or anyone else to identify you. They delete all data after 90 days. If an issue is persistent we may ask you to share some information which will help us identify the specific session you are having difficulty with. This information will be requested through the support portal only and will only identify you by your Self user ID. Once the problems have been resolved the data will be deleted and you will be notified that it has been deleted. ‍
14. If you no longer want a Self Membership You can delete the App and your account at any time by choosing “delete account” from the Settings menu. Doing so will remove all your data from your phone and from backups. Once your App has been deleted, your Member details can be recovered, but your data will no longer be available.
15. General legal points If you have a complaint regarding the service or you wish to exercise your privacy rights, please contact us by emailing our support team or through the support portal in the Self App. We will handle all complaints about data privacy within one month.

</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/agreements/privacy_notice/"},{value:"Authentication",label:`<p>Self provides an easy to implement Multi-factor and Biometric Authentication System, which ensures a higher level of security for your applications. The Self Authentication System allows for seamless integration of biometric authentication without the need for passwords or codes, verifying users directly from their phones.
Features Biometric authentication: Verifies users through unique biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints or facial recognition.
Privacy-focused: Authenticates users by their Self Identifier without storing any other personal information.
Easy integration: Simple implementation of authentication workflow using the Self SDKs.
Workflow A user enters their Self Identifier (ID) within your application. Your application requests authentication using the user&rsquo;s ID. The user receives an authentication request on their phone, which may require biometric verification (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition). If the user successfully accepts the authentication request you&rsquo;ll be able to grant the current user Implementation Example The following example demonstrates how to implement an authentication workflow using the Self Ruby SDKs.
user = &quot;1112223334&quot;authenticated = @app.authentication.request(user).accepted?user := &quot;1112223334&quot;if resp, err != client.AuthenticationService().Request(user); err != nil {println(&quot;authentication rejected&quot;)return}authenticated := resp.Acceptedlet res = await client.authentication().request(&quot;1112223334&quot;)let authenticated = res.isAccepted()Steps to Implement the Authentication System Integrate the Self SDKs into your application. Allow users to enter their Self Identifier (ID) within your application. Request authentication by calling the authentication.request() method, passing the user&rsquo;s ID as an argument. Check if the authentication is accepted by evaluating the accepted? method. Benefits Enhanced security: Multi-factor and biometric authentication provides an additional layer of security for your applications, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
Improved user experience: Users no longer need to remember complex passwords or codes, as authentication is handled through Self identifiers.
Privacy-focused: The system verifies users by their ID without storing any other personal information, reducing the risk of data breaches.
Conclusion The Multi-Factor and Biometric Authentication System offers an effective and secure way to authenticate users for your applications.
By implementing this system, you can offer your users a more convenient and secure authentication experience, while also protecting their privacy.
</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/authentication/"},{value:"Response",label:`<p>Subscribe Users can respond to authentication requests by accepting or rejecting them. On the other hand, you won’t receive asynchronous notifications for requests which have timed out.
You can subscribe to authentication responses with this snippet
@client.authentication.subscribe do |auth_res|puts resp.statusendclient.MessagingService().Subscribe(&quot;identities.authenticate.req&quot;, func(m *messaging.Message)) {// manage the response}client.messaging().subscribe(&quot;identities.authenticate.req&quot;, (res: any): any =&gt; {// manage the response})Processing the response if resp.accepted?p &quot;accepted&quot;elsif resp.rejected?p &quot;rejected&quot;elsif resp.unauthorized?p &quot;unauthorized&quot;elsif resp.errored?p &quot;errored&quot;elsep &quot;unkonwn status&quot;end// Or simply access the status string p resp.status // Go SDK will return an error for unsuccessful// responseserr = authService.Request(&quot;1112223334&quot;)if err != nil {log.Fatal(&quot;auth returned with: &quot;, err)}log.Println(&quot;authentication succeeded&quot;) try {let res = await client.authentication().request(&quot;1112223334&quot;)if(res.isAccepted() == true) {client.logger.info(`\${res.selfID} is now authenticated 🤘`)} else if(res.accepted == false) {client.logger.warn(`\${res.selfID} has rejected your authentication request`)} else {client.logger.error(res.errorMessage)}} catch (error) {client.logger.error(error.toString())}The interesting field in an authentication response is status. Valid values for status are:
accepted The user has accepted the authentication request, so you can proceed authenticating it on your app.
rejected The user has rejected the authentication request.
unauthorized You’re unauthorized to interact with this user, let it know it needs to be connected to your app before continuing with an authentication process.
errored An internal error happened.
Depending on the SDK there are different ways you can deal with different status, see some examples below
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/authentication/response/"},{value:"Response",label:`<p>Subscribe As the user also has the option to accept or reject a fact request, the response also comes with a status property and some helpers like the authentication response.
Additionally a fact response comes with a list of attestations for the requested fact.
Subscribing to a facts response is similar to authentication.

@groups = {} @app.chat.on_invite do |group| @groups[group.gid] = group group.join group.message(&quot;hi&quot;) end @app.chat.on_join do |msg| @groups[msg[:gid]].members &lt;&lt; msg[:iss] end @app.chat.on_leave do |msg| @groups[msg[:gid]].members.delete(msg[:iss]) end @app.chat.on_message do |msg| return if msg.gid.nil? puts &quot;[#{@groups[msg.gid].name}] #{msg.from}: #{msg.body}&quot; end groups := make(map[string]*chat.Group, 0) chat.ChatService().OnInvite(func(g *chat.Group) { g.Join() groups[g.GID] = g g.Message(&quot;hey!&quot;) }) cs.OnLeave(func(iss, gid string) { delete(groups, gid) }) chat.ChatService().OnJoin(func(iss, gid string) { if _, ok := groups[gid]; ok { groups[gid].Members = append(groups[gid].Members, iss) } }) chat.ChatService().OnMessage(func(cm *chat.Message) { if len(cm.GID) == 0 { return } fmt.Printf(&quot;[%s] %s: %s&quot;, groups[cm.GID].Name, cm.Iss, cm.Body) }) let groups = {} sdk.chat().onInvite(async (g: ChatGroup) =&gt; { g.join() groups[g.gid] = g await groups[g.gid].message(&quot;hey!&quot;) }) sdk.chat().onJoin(async (iss: string, gid: string) =&gt; { groups[gid].members.push(iss) }) sdk.chat().onLeave(async (iss: string, gid: string) =&gt; { delete groups[gid].members[iss] }) sdk.chat().OnMessage(async (cm: ChatMessage) =&gt; { if (len(cm.gid) &gt; 0) { console.log(`[\${groups[cm.gid].name}] \${cm.iss}: \${cm.body}`) } }) As you can see this example manages every group incoming message, to keep an in memory updated list of groups with its members.
Creating a group Your app is als also able to create a group by calling invite method. members = [user1, user2, user3] @app.chat.invite &quot;my_gid&quot;, &quot;Group name&quot;, members members = []string{user1, user2, user3} client.ChatService().Invite(&quot;my_gid&quot;, &quot;Group name&quot;, members) let members = [user1, user2, user3] sdk.chat().Invite(&quot;my_gid&quot;, &quot;Group name&quot;, members) Have in mind you can send messages to a newly created group, but those messages will only be delivered to the group members that have decided to join the group.
Groups can also have an image as avatar, you can pass a file contents as parameter to chat invite to provide that image. members = [user1, user2, user3] URI.open(&quot;https://www.avasflowers.net/img/prod_img/avasflowers-dreaming-of-tuscany-bouquet.jpg&quot;) do |image| @groups[gid] = @app.chat.invite(gid, &quot;MagicGroup&quot;, members, { data: image.read, mime: &quot;image/jpg&quot; }) end members = []string{user1, user2, user3} data, err := os.ReadFile(&quot;/tmp/dat&quot;) check(err) client.ChatService().Invite(&quot;my_gid&quot;, &quot;Group name&quot;, members, chat.InviteOptions{ Data: data, Mime: &quot;image.gif&quot;, }) import * as fs from 'fs'; let data = fs.readFileSync('foo.txt','utf8'); let members = [user1, user2, user3] sdk.chat().Invite(&quot;my_gid&quot;, &quot;Group name&quot;, members, { &quot;data&quot;: data, &quot;mime&quot;: &quot;image/gif&quot;, }) Messaging and groups Sending messages to a group is as easy as calling the message method on that group. Additionally once you receive a message on a group you will have access to all its helpers to continue the conversation without having to care about the group itself.

Language URL Go https://github.com/joinself/self-go-sdk Ruby https://github.com/joinself/self-ruby-sdk/ Typescript https://github.com/joinself/self-typescript-sdk/ Referencing the SDK SelfSDK is referenced like any other library for each specific language.
require &quot;selfsdk&quot; import &quot;github.com/joinself/self-go-sdk&quot; const SelfSDK = require(&quot;self-sdk&quot;); Storage key generation Self-SDK locally persists session and account information needed for end to end encryption. A SELF_STORAGE_KEY is required to securely encrypt this information. It is recommended that you use a large random string for your SELF_STORAGE_KEY. You can generate a random string through the command line with:
$ LC_ALL=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c64
Keep that key in a secure place as you’ll need it to initialize a connection.
Basic connection A basic connection to Self network only requires your SELF_APP_ID, SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET, SELF_STORAGE_KEY and SELF_STORAGE_DIR.
You may want to add SELF_APP_ID, SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET, SELF_STORAGE_KEY and SELF_STORAGE_DIR as environment variables.

ACL - Access Control List An access control list (ACL) is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.
&nbsp
AISP - Account Information Service Provider Account Information Service Provider (AISP) lets you see all of your account information from different bank accounts in one place online or in a mobile app. AISPs can include budgeting apps and price comparison websites offering budgeting help and product recommendations. An AISP needs your explicit consent to provide you with these services.
&nbsp
AML - Anti Money Laundering Refers to all policies and pieces of legislation that force financial institutions to proactively monitor their clients in order to prevent money laundering and corruption.
&nbsp
API - Application Programming Interface API (application programming interface) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. &nbsp
Attestation The act of an individual or organisational SelfID to attest / confirm / authenticate / validate / prove true another individual or organisational SelfIDs claim. &nbsp
Aure Self’s native token, used for paying for transactions on Self Blockchain A growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash). a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. &nbsp
Certificate Authority A Certificate Authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. Claim A declaration by an individual or organisational SeflID of some information about itself, or an asset it owns, that is sent to one or more other individual or organisational SelfIDs to attest to. &nbsp
CLI - Command Line Interface A text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way. &nbsp
Cold Storage Cold storage is an offline wallet provided for storing cryptocurrencies. With cold storage, the digital wallet is stored on a platform that is not connected to the internet, thereby, protecting the wallet from unauthorised access, cyber hacks, and other vulnerabilities that a system connected to the internet is susceptible to. &nbsp
DID - Decentralised Identifier Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralised registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs resolve to DID Documents — simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID. Each DID Document contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints. Cryptographic material combined with authentication suites provide a set of mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g., public keys, pseudonymous biometric protocols, etc.). Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the DID subject. &nbsp
Digital Certificate The digital certificate also known as public key certificate, or identity certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the public key that is certified. &nbsp
DLT - Distributed Ledger Technology A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronised across network spread across multiple sites, institutions or geographies. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses," thereby making a cyberattack more difficult. The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Further, any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes. &nbsp
DRI - Directly Responsible Individual Directly Responsible Individual relates to the person who is allocated as the owner of an Epic or a specific task. &nbsp
DUNS Number The DUNS number is a nine-digit number, issued and regulated by D&B (Dun & Bradstreet - a company that provides commercial data, analytics, and insights for businesses). It is assigned to a single business entity, having a unique, separate, and distinct operation for the purpose of identifying them. &nbsp
E2E - End-to-end End to End encryptions allows only the users communicating can read the messages. &nbsp
Epic Epics represent the specific tasks or a body of work that can be broken down into use cases. Milestones consist of a number of Epics to be completed. &nbsp
FCA - Financial Conduct Authority The Financial Conduct Authority is a financial regulatory body in the United Kingdom, but operates independently of the UK Government. &nbsp
Hash Encoding of data in to a small and generally fixed size &nbsp
HLF - Hyperledger Fabric A Fabric permissioned blockchain network is a technical infrastructure that provides ledger services to application consumers and administrators. In most cases, multiple organisations come together as a consortium to form the network and their permissions are determined by a set of policies that are agreed to by the consortium when the network is originally configured. Moreover, network policies &nbsp
Horizon API Server Horizon is an API server for the Stellar ecosystem. It acts as the interface between stellar-core and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. &nbsp
Hot Storage Hot storage is online wallet provided for storing cryptocurrencies. With hot storage, the digital wallet is stored on a platform that is connected to the internet. Differently from a cold storage, a hot storage is subjected to unauthorised access, cyber hacks, and other vulnerabilities that a system connected to the internet is susceptible to. &nbsp
Hyperledger Hyperledger is a multi-project open source collaborative effort hosted by The Linux Foundation. We are using it to store the self ID into a public key mapping, and potentially to store the SelfID score too. &nbsp
JWE - JSON Web Encryption JSON Web Encryption is an IETF standard providing a standardised syntax for the exchange of encrypted data, based on JSON and Base64. It forms part of the JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) suite of protocols. &nbsp
JWS - JSON Web Signature JSON Web Signature is an IETF proposed standard [RFC7515] for signing arbitrary data. JWS is a way to ensure integrity of information in a highly serialisable, machine-readable format. That means that it is information, along with proof that the information hasn't changed since being signed. It can be used for sending information from one web site to another, and is especially aimed at communications on the web. It even contains a compact form optimised for applications like URI query parameters. &nbsp
JWT - JSON Web Tokens JWT - JSON Web Tokens is a JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens that assert a certain number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. &nbsp
K8S The container orchestration tool that hosts the Self platform. &nbsp
KYC - Know Your Customer Know your Customer (Client) checks allows businesses to verify the identity of their clients. Guidelines are often dictated by government or financial authorities such as the FCA. &nbsp
Node A node is a device on a blockchain network, that is in essence the foundation of the technology, allowing it to function and survive. The role of a node is to support the network by maintaining a copy of a blockchain and, in some cases, to process transactions. &nbsp
OAuth - Open Authorisation OAuth is a simple way to interact with private data, allowing third parties limited access to a web-service via access tokens at the authorisation of the account owner. &nbsp
Open Banking The use of open API’s to enable third parties access to details from an individual's bank account. &nbsp
Oracle An oracle, in the context of blockchains and smart contracts, is an agent that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used by smart contracts. ... An oracle is a data feed – provided by third party service – designed for use in smart contracts on the blockchain. In the case of Self/Biler a good example is the Client Payment Oracle/Fiat Currency Gateway. This gets notified by webhook from the bank (ideally) of the deposit of fiat currency into a client money account, it then credits the deposited fiat funds with a corresponding tokenized form of the currency which can be controlled by a User’s private keys. &nbsp
P2P - Peer-to-peer Peer-to-peer computing is a distributed application architecture that partitions workloads between peers. &nbsp
PDS - Personal Data Store A platform where people can securely store, manage and share their data. &nbsp
PIFI - Personally Identifiable Financial Information Personally identifiable financial information (PIFI) is any type of personally identifiable information (PII) that is linked to that person's finances. A credit card number is a prime example of PIFI. &nbsp
PII - Personally Identifiable Information Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymising anonymous data can be considered PII. PII can be sensitive or non-sensitive. Non-sensitive PII is information that can be transmitted in an unencrypted form without resulting in harm to the individual. Non-sensitive PII can be easily gathered from public records, phone books, corporate directories and websites.
Sensitive PII is information which, when disclosed, could result in harm to the individual whose privacy has been breached. Sensitive PII should, therefore, be encrypted in transit and when data is at rest. Such information includes biometric information, medical information, personally identifiable financial information (PIFI) and unique identifiers such as passport or Social Security numbers.
&nbsp
PISP - Payment Initiation Service Provider A Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) lets you pay companies directly from your bank account rather than using your debit or credit card through a third-party such as Visa or MasterCard. A PISP needs your explicit consent before providing you with this kind of service. &nbsp
PKI - Public Key Infrastructure A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. &nbsp
Ripple Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc. that provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain and the XRP token. &nbsp
SC - Smart Contract Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralised blockchain network. A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. Stablecoin/Stable Token
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to minimise the price volatility. Stablecoins are used as stores of value or units of account, as well as in other use cases where volatile cryptocurrencies may be less desirable. Authors of stablecoins use different designs to achieve price stability. The value of a stablecoin can be pegged to fiat currencies, or to exchange traded commodities (such as gold, silver, other precious and industrial metals, etc). Stablecoins can be centralised where they can be backed by fiat and exchange-traded commodities directly, or in a decentralised fashion via leveraging other cryptocurrency projects in different ways.
&nbsp
Stellar Stellar is an open-source, decentralised protocol for digital currency to fiat currency transfers which allows cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies using the XLM token. &nbsp
Token Crypto tokens are special kind of virtual currency tokens that reside on their own blockchains and represent an asset or utility. For example, one can have a crypto token that represents x number of customer loyalty points on a blockchain that is used to manage such details for a retail chain. &nbsp
TrustLine (Stellar/Ripple Specific) The Trustlines Network is the original Ripple idea built on Ethereum. The Trustlines Network targets the problem of fair access to money by implementing money as bilateral peer-to-peer issued blockchain-based credit. We are developing an open source protocol, including a mobile app empowering end-users to make global payments based on their existing trusted social network. &nbsp
UID - Unique Identifier A unique identifier (UID) is a numeric or alphanumeric string that is associated with a single entity within a given system. UIDs make it possible to address that entity so that it can be accessed and interacted with. &nbsp
Use Case Use Cases are a list of actions or event steps between a role and a system to achieve a goal, and typically consist of a set of possible scenarios between the two. &nbsp
Verifier The party who needs to trust a claim &nbsp
VoIP - Voice over IP Voice over Internet Protocol delivers voice communications over the internet, likely meaning it is lower cost. An example of this would be Skype. &nbsp
WOT - Web of Trust a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. Its decentralised trust model is an alternative to the centralised trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs. &nbsp
ZKP - Zero Knowledge Proofs A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that something is true, without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true. </p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/quickstart/glossary/"},{value:"Data Processing Agreement",label:`<p>This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) is subject to and forms part of your Self Commercial Terms and Conditions and governs Self’s Processing of Personal Data.

Each fact has the following properties:
Sources A fact’s source represents where this fact comes from, for example a DOB can come from different sources such as a passport or a driving license. By default this field is set with a wildcard “*” and the user will select the source on their device. Same happens if you specify multiple sources.
At the moment there are three different sources user_specified, passport and driving_license.
As this list is always growing, you can check the possible values on your SDK ruby-sdk and go-sdk.
Fact This is the name of the fact you want to request like display_name, email_address or phone_number.
The list of values by source is:
user_specified: display_name, email_address and phone_number passport and _identity-card _: document_number, surname, given_names, date_of_birth, date_of_expiration, sex, nationality, _country_of_issuance. driving_license : document_number, surname, given_names, date_of_birth, date_of_issuance, date_of_expiration, address, issuing_authority, place_of_birth, country_of_issuance. Attestations A list of verified attestations signed by an issuer. This only has content on fact request responses, and it contains a list of attestations for the current fact.
Expected value When you send an intermediary fact check you expect the value of a user’s fact to be compared with an expected value, this field is where you will provide that value.
Operator On an intermediary fact check this field contains the operator used to compare the expected value against the expected value. Valid operators can be found here
Fact requests Fact requests allow your app to request specific facts from identities on the Self-network.
Only verified facts can be requested
The approaches to request facts are similar to authentication, so let&rsquo;s have a look at them.
By default fact requests will expire after 15 minutes, you can change this defaults with `Expiry` option.</p>`,url:"https://docs.joinself.com/sdk/facts/"},{value:"QR",label:`<p>Presenting users with a QR makes your authentication workflow more convenient for users on non-mobile devices.
The authentication workflow using QR codes allows users to authenticate on your project without handwriting its self identifier, just by scanning the QR code you&rsquo;re providing.
# Generate a QR code to authenticate @app.authentication .generate_qr .as_png(border: 0, size: 400) .save('/tmp/qr.png', :interlace =&gt; true) qrdata, err := s.auth.GenerateQRCode(&amp;authentication.QRAuthenticationRequest{ QRConfig: fact.QRConfig{ Size: 400, BackgroundColor: &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;, ForegroundColor: &quot;#000000&quot;, }, }) let buf = sdk.authentication().generateQR() const fs = require('fs').promises; await fs.writeFile('/tmp/qr.png', buf); Once the user scans the QR code with its device and accepts the authentication request, it will send back an authentication response to your app.
Have in mind the user&rsquo;s device will send you back an authentication response, so setup a subscription to that topic.

Public objects Most of the time we only share public images, and in this case we don&rsquo;t require the document to be encrypted, so we can directly share the URL.
opts = { objects: [{ link: &quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14011726/94132137-7d4fc100-fe7c-11ea-8512-69f90cb65e48.gif&quot;, name: &quot;homer&quot;, mime: &quot;image/gif&quot;, }] } client.message user, &quot;ready!&quot;, opts obj := chat.MessageObject{ Name: &quot;Hello&quot;, Link: &quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14011726/94132137-7d4fc100-fe7c-11ea-8512-69f90cb65e48.gif&quot;, Mime: &quot;image/gif&quot;, } m, err = client.ChatService().Message([]string{os.Args[1]}, &quot;no way...&quot;, chat.MessageOptions{ Objects: []chat.MessageObject{obj}, }) opts = { &quot;objects&quot;: [{ &quot;link&quot;: &quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14011726/94132137-7d4fc100-fe7c-11ea-8512-69f90cb65e48.gif&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;mime&quot;: &quot;image/gif&quot;, }]} client.chat().message user, &quot;ready!&quot;, opts) Non-public objects All non-public objects shared between identities are encrypted by default using Poly1305. This encryption layer is built on the SDK, so should be transparent for end users. Let&rsquo;s see how we can send a local file.

Custom facts will allow you to:
Create custom facts. Store facts on the user&rsquo;s device. Consume custom facts. Share custom facts with other apps. Interact with other apps on the Self ecosystem. All this is basically accomplished by using the user&rsquo;s device as secure storage for critical information.
Issuing facts Groups Facts are presented to the user in groups. Groups have name and icon properties.
param description required name The name of the group as it will be displayed to the user. true icon The icon to be displayed close to the group name false Self App supports all material UI icons, you can search all available icons on google fonts.
This is how we can create a group.
my_group = SelfSDK::Services::Facts::Group.new( &quot;Trip to Venice&quot;, &quot;airplanemode_active&quot; ) g := fact.FactGroup{ Name: &quot;Trip to Shangai&quot;, Icon: &quot;airplanemode_active&quot;, } let group = new Group(&quot;group name&quot;, &quot;plane&quot;) Facts Facts are composed of a key, a value and a source.
param description required key is the id for the fact, it will allow other apps to request your facts by id. true value It&rsquo;s stored as a string by default true source it groups facts from the same source, it allows other apps to use it as filters. true group if group is not provided facts will end under on the ungrouped section on the user&rsquo;s device false type it defines how the fact has to be processed by other clients, it defaults to string, but can also be set as password or delegation_certificate false my_fact = SelfSDK::Services::Facts::Fact.new( &quot;confirmation_code&quot;, &quot;CD128763&quot;, &quot;source12&quot;, group: my_group) f := fact.FactToIssue{ Key: &quot;BCN-SIN-cc&quot;, Value: &quot;CD128763&quot;, Source: source, Group: &amp;g, } let fact = new FactToIssue(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, source, { group: group }) Issuing facts Once you have your fact defined, it&rsquo;s time to send it to your user&rsquo;s device. You can do this by calling issue method on the facts service.
param description required user the user you&rsquo;re signing and sending facts to true facts an array with the facts you want to issue true viewers an array of app identifiers related to apps apps that can consume this facts false @app.facts.issue(user, my_fact], viewers: [appID1, appID2]) client.FactService().Issue(selfid, []fact.FactToIssue{f}, []string{}) await sdk.facts().issue(selfID, [fact]) Retrieving facts Retrieving facts is pretty much the same as we do for accessing core facts, the only difference is we must specify what issuers are we going to be accepting on our request, let&rsquo;s see an example.
myAppID = ENV[&quot;SELF_APP_ID&quot;] @app.facts.request(user, [{ fact: my_fact.key, issuers: [myAppID] }]) do |res| if res.status == &quot;rejected&quot; puts 'Information request rejected' exit! end k = my_fact.key.to_sym a = res.attestation_values_for(k) puts &quot;Your stored fact is #{a.first}!&quot; end resp, err := client.FactService().Request(&amp;fact.FactRequest{ SelfID: selfid, Description: &quot;We need access to your flight confirmation codes to reschedule your flights&quot;, Facts: []fact.Fact{ { Fact: f[0].Key, Sources: []string{source}, Issuers: []string{appID}, }, }, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, }) let res = await sdk.facts().request(selfID, [{ fact: fact.key, issuers: [ appID ] }]) Scope and facts Custom facts scope is configurable by the developer by using viewers and issuers parameters to facts.issue and facts.request. This makes it possible to create private, protected and public custom facts.
Private By specifying yourself as the only viewers on a facts.issue you will be creating facts you&rsquo;re the only one able to consume.
Protected Specifying multiple app ids as viewers you&rsquo;ll make those facts available only to a subset of apps.
Public When viewers parameter is not provided, issued facts become public.

A dynamic link will authenticate a user on your platform by clicking a link and accepting the authentication request on his phone.
As part of this process, you have to share the generated link with your users, and wait for a response.
In order to use a dynamic link, you must generate a redirection code on the developer portal, once you have it you can use it to generate a url which you can share with your users.
url = @client.authentication.generate_deep_link(redirection_code) link, err := authService.GenerateDeepLink(&amp;authentication.DeepLinkAuthenticationRequest{ ConversationID: cid, Callback: redirectionCode, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, }) if err != nil { log.Fatal(&quot;auth returned with: &quot;, err) } let url = sdk.authentication().generateDeepLink(redirectionCode) Have in mind the user&rsquo;s device will send you back an authentication response, so setup a subscription to that topic.

It is all about data privacy Your data belongs to you. We believe it is safer for people and better for businesses for you to control your data. Self enables you to allow others to use your personal data only for specific reasons and you remain in control of that.
Current Regulations, such as GDPR are a good start, but we think they don&rsquo;t go far enough. No company needs to keep your data (unless they are required to by law), especially if they use Self.
At Self we believe in only holding data we have to hold*, and being clear as to the specific purpose of holding that data. Our privacy policy governs what personal information of yours we hold, why we hold it and how we use it.
*We would hold no personal data at all if we could get away with it.
2. So, What is Self? Self consists of the “App” (which you have just downloaded) and a “Network” across which “Members” (you and other users of the App) can share verified information securely. The App gives you access to the Network and lets you verify, share and control the use of the personal data “Facts” you store in it. The App lets you use Facts about yourself to make your everyday interactions with people and businesses you trust easier and safer.
As well as using Self to protect your data and your rights to privacy; you can use the App to replace logins, account numbers and other identifying information with third parties who support Self, including businesses and other organisations.
Your Membership is unique to you and the data you store in Self exists only on your phone under your control unless you choose to share it. It is never shared with or visible to us other than with your explicit consent and under your control as set out below. When you do share data, you determine who it is shared with.
Sharing data through Self is free to you as an individual user; we will however charge businesses and organisations for requesting data from you or for checking your Membership. In the future we may release new features, which may carry a charge, but these will always be optional. This privacy notice explains how your data is used inside the Self App and in the limited cases where it is used or stored by Self Group, how your data is used and protected.
4. Data Collection and Use We enable you to verify personal information which you can then share from the Self App on your phone. To do this we have to collect some information which we store temporarily during verification and two pieces of information which we keep permanently (or until you replace them); your email and your mobile phone number. We do this for several reasons:
To check if you already have an account. To create your account To verify that a document you add to your account is yours. To check you are the correct living, specific person. For authentication. 5. What Data Do We Collect? A Photo of you. **We capture an image of you during the registration process. This image is stored on your phone encrypted with keys only you hold.
The image we capture is encrypted and kept on your device in the App. When you need to biometrically verify yourself - for example during a login - the image is used to verify you are both who you say you are and the person the account being accessed was given to. This verification is sometimes done by sending the images to an external service where they are stored only while they are being processed and then deleted. The image is never shared with a third party except during the automated process of verification. The image is never linked to any other personal data. You keep this image on your phone until you delete your account. Further photos of you. Every time you use the Self App to verify your identity you capture another photograph. These images are all stored in the app in encrypted form until your account is deleted. Apart from during the verification process for which they were created, they cannot be shared. Over time these images are used to train an on-device model which can be used to recognise you.
Your email address. Your email address(es) are also used by you for discovery of other people who you know in Self. Existing Self users who hold each other&rsquo;s contact details in their device address books and who permit access to their contacts are able to see each other as Self users.
If you contact Self support through the App you will agree to share your email address with Zendesk Inc who provide our external support process. Your mobile phone number. Your phone number is also used in hashed form by you for discovery of other people who you know in Self. Existing Self users who hold each other&rsquo;s contact details in their device address books and who permit access to their contacts are able to see each other as Self users.
6. Data Location and Security The personal data we hold is stored securely in data centres in the UK. All data is encrypted. We hold no personal information other than that stated in Section 5.
7. Your Rights Self holds only two pieces of personally identifiable data on any user. you have the right to correct, delete and restrict us from using the data we hold all of which you can do from within your Self App.
8. Using the Self App to store and verify Data ** **Once you have joined Self and logged in to the App there will be a section marked Profile. This is for you to use to store Facts about yourself. Facts you added to Self during sign up will be displayed there and if they have been verified as being true by an authoritative third party they will be marked with a ticked shield.
The Facts only exist in your App (and in your encrypted device backup in iCloud or Google Cloud); they are verified bits of personal data which another Member has confirmed are true. You can add Facts to the App and ask Members you are connected to (both organisations and individuals) to verify those Facts are true. Organisations you are connected to can add custom fields to your profile to share relationship specific Facts too - like Account numbers and preferences.
You can add additional Facts about yourself and ask for them to be verified. This might include e-mail or physical addresses, your full name, details of your employer or the details from an official document like a passport or driving licence. Through the App you can share Facts about yourself with Members you are connected to. Even though you have chosen to be connected to another Member, you should be careful about the Facts that you share and the purpose that you are sharing them for. Your Facts are valuable and you should avoid giving them away without a good reason.
Requestors can ask to have access to a fact for a defined period of time if they are doing something that requires repeated access to the fact. This saves them storing your data while ensuring they have access to it if it is needed. You can revoke this access at any time.
The App contains a list of the Members you are connected to and the Facts you have shared with each one. The App also lets you check and manage all your sharing. We do not have access to any of the facts you store in your Self App other than those set out in Section 5.
9. App Recovery If you lose access to your Self account or the device it was installed on you can recover your account using your biometric. Just press recover account on a new install of the App and providing it has access to the backup from the device where Self was previously installed, you will be able to recover your account by pressing “Recover Account” and following the on screen instructions.
We cannot currently recover between platforms (iOS and Android) and if you lose access to your backups or they are damaged you will be unable to recover a lost Self account.
**SELF GROUP HAVE NO ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR DATA AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE, OR HOLD PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER AN ACCOUNT. **
10. Biometrics and PIN You can choose to access the App using a device biometric check like a fingerprint or face scan. If you choose to enable device biometrics you will also be asked to create a 6 digit PIN for accessing the App in emergency. You must make sure no one else has access to your PIN, so it stays safe and private.
11. Which Biometrics does the App Use? Facial. The images we capture of your face allow us to determine if the person using the App is the correct person. Some actions you want to take while using the app will require you to take a photo and liveness check to confirm you match the biometrics taken when you set up the account. Liveness. We use a range of technologies to check that the person claiming to be you is not an imposter, this could be using video, AI or other background information. These checks are done on the phone and are automated. Self Group has no access to the checks or their output, they are designed for you to use in your Self App to strengthen your ID security. 12. Encryption and Data Backup All data stored in your App will be encrypted on your mobile in the App. Any data being shared is encrypted end-to-end. Backups of your data and membership details will be stored encrypted in the cloud drive nominated by you during the joining process. It is your responsibility to keep your phone, login details and recovery details safe, and to prevent others from having unauthorised access to your membership details.
13. Data that helps us fix problems you experience We use Crashlytics which sends us information automatically if the app has problems or crashes. None of the information they gather allows us or anyone else to identify you. They delete all data after 90 days. If an issue is persistent we may ask you to share some information which will help us identify the specific session you are having difficulty with. This information will be requested through the support portal only and will only identify you by your Self user ID. Once the problems have been resolved the data will be deleted and you will be notified that it has been deleted.
14. If you no longer want a Self Membership You can delete the App and your account at any time by choosing “delete account” from the Settings menu. Doing so will remove all your data from your phone and from backups. Once your App has been deleted, your Member details can be recovered, but your data will no longer be available.
15. General legal points If you have a complaint regarding the service or you wish to exercise your privacy rights, please contact us by emailing our support team or through the support portal in the Self App. We will handle all complaints about data privacy within one month.

This becomes really useful if accurate data is needed in real time.
If data is required periodically, Self&rsquo;s recurrent requests allow the same data to be accessed for a specified period without requiring re-authorization by the user. This avoids the organization needing to store and protect the data.
Recurrent requests are exactly the same as regular fact requests, except for the addition of an allowed_for modifier as demonstrated below:
ten_days = 10 * 60 * 60 * 60 # Request email, with recurrent requests enabled for ten days res = @client.facts.request(user, [:email_address], allowed_for: ten_days) # At this point the user will be prompted with a confirmation box to # allow access its email for the next 10 days. # # If we send the same request again, it will be automatically shared by the device # without user interaction. res = @client.facts.request(user, [:email_address]) // Request email, with recurrent requests enabled for ten days resp, err := client.FactService().Request(&amp;fact.FactRequest{ SelfID: selfID, Description: &quot;info&quot;, Facts: []fact.Fact{{ Fact: fact.FactEmail }}, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, AllowedFor: time.Day * 10, }) check(err) // At this point the user will be prompted with a confirmation box to // allow access its email for the next 10 days. // // If we send the same request again, it will be automatically shared by the device // without user interaction. resp, err := client.FactService().Request(&amp;fact.FactRequest{ SelfID: selfID, Description: &quot;info&quot;, Facts: []fact.Fact{{ Fact: fact.FactEmail }}, Expiry: time.Minute * 5, }) check(err) let tenDays = 10 * 60 * 60 * 60 // Request email, with recurrent requests enabled for ten days let res = await sdk.facts().request(user, [{ fact: &rsquo;email_address&rsquo;, allowed_for: tenDays }]) // At this point the user will be prompted with a confirmation box to // allow access its email for the next 10 days. // // If we send the same request again, it will be automatically shared by the device // without user interaction. let res = await sdk.facts().request(user, [{ fact: &rsquo;email_address&rsquo; }]) Given the user is always able to cancel this recurrent requests at any time, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to include the allowed for modifier on every request.
Even the responses to your fact requests are automated by the user, have in mind the request always hits the user&rsquo;s device, so the response can take some time to get back to you..

That means they need to worry less about running a secure compliant environment.
How do they work? Intermediary fact checks are useful when you want to run a check of a user’s verified fact without having to gain access to that fact.
Eg. You want to verify a user is over 18, but you don’t want to deal with their personal information. An intermediary fact check allows you to run a zero knowledge check on that information via a trusted intermediary.
This is useful both for you and your users because you can prove a fact without ever directly interacting to them.

For example, you may need a user to digitally sign to indicate their agreement to your terms and conditions.
Plain text signatures Self allows the signing of arbitrary text as demonstrated below:

Calls follow this flow:
start a start message instructs an identity to initiate a call with the issuer of the message using the same cid. accept the incoming call is accepted by the call recipient who must respond with the details to start the call. busy notifies the call issuer that the recipient is busy and cannot answer the call. stop signals that the call has been ended by one of the participants.

To do this, you will need API keys which can be obtained by registering on the Self Developer Portal.\nYou have the option of obtaining credentials for two distinct environments, it is suggested to first develop and test your app on the sandbox environment, once it is stable and working as expected, you can then submit it for approval on the production environment, keep in mind that the approval process for production environment may take some time.\nEnvironments Sandbox Get started with test credentials and life-like data Production Launch your app with live credentials API Keys SELF_APP_ID Public app identifier SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET Private key Setting up your app Before we even get started with the code we need to have a valid Self-app credentials so the quick start can interact with the Self-network.\nThis can be done through the developer portal, if you&rsquo;re just getting started you can get those from the Sandbox Developer Portal.\nThis documentation site has a whole section describing how to create and tune your self-app for your specific needs, check it out for more detailed information. In order to prepare your app to run all the examples you should configure it properly on the portal:\nMark the app as listed Mark it as allows messaging Mark it as allows voice Additionally, you must connect to your app on your device, so you can interact with it\nQuickstart setup Once you have obtained your API keys, the next step is to execute the Self Quickstart on your local machine. The guidance provided below will assist you in duplicating the Quickstart repository, adjusting the ./examples/.env file with your own Self client ID and Sandbox secret, and ultimately, compiling and launching the application.\nThe Self-Quickstart is available in both Docker and non-Docker options. If you don&rsquo;t have Docker installed on your system, you might want to use the non-Docker version, particularly for Windows users who do not have Docker installed. However, if you already have Docker installed, it is recommended to use the Docker option as it is more straightforward and simpler to execute the Quickstart. The instructions provided below will guide you through the process of setting up the Quickstart with both Docker and non-Docker configurations.\nSetting up with Docker (Recommended) Docker is a platform and technology for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. It uses containerization, a method of packaging software in a way that ensures it runs consistently across different environments. Docker allows developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single container, which can then be easily deployed and run on any machine that has the Docker runtime installed. This makes it easy to manage and distribute applications, and helps ensure that the application will run consistently across different environments.\nOnce you have Docker installed, open the Docker application, and then utilize the following commands in the command line interface to set up and execute the Quickstart. In case the &lsquo;demo&rsquo; commands do not function as expected, confirm that Docker is running.\n# Notes for MacOS / Linux # Clone self-ruby-sdk $ git clone https://github.com/joinself/self-ruby-sdk.git $ cd self-ruby-sdk # Copy the ./examples/.env.example file to ./examples/.env, then fill out SELF_APP_ID # and SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET in .env $ cp ./examples/.env.example ./examples/.env # start the container $ ./demo up # Finally run the quick start demo $ ./demo run # Notes for Windows # Clone self-ruby-sdk $ docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/git alpine/git clone https://github.com/joinself/self-ruby-sdk $ cd self-ruby-sdk # Copy the ./examples/.env.example file to ./examples/.env $ cp .\\examples\\.env.example .\\examples\\.env # Add SELF_APP_ID and SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET to .env $ notepad .\\examples\\.env # required in order to run local scripts Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned # start the container $ .\\demo.ps1 up # Finally run the quick start demo $ .\\demo.ps1 run Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted Stop the container with ./demo down\nSetting up without Docker Self SDK comes with some dependencies on native libraries to manage encryption libself_olm and libself_omemo.\nBelow you&rsquo;ll find the instructions to get them working on your system.\nDebian/Ubuntu $ curl -O https://download.joinself.com/olm/libself-olm_0.1.17_amd64.deb $ curl -O https://download.joinself.com/omemo/libself-omemo_0.1.2_amd64.deb $ apt install libsodium-dev $ apt install ./libself-olm_0.1.17_amd64.deb ./libself-omemo_0.1.2_amd64.deb Redhat/Centos $ rpm -Uvh https://download.joinself.com/olm/libself-olm-0.1.14-1.x86_64.rpm $ rpm -Uvh https://download.joinself.com/omemo/libself-omemo-0.1.2-1.x86_64.rpm Mac (x86_64) $ brew tap joinself/crypto $ brew install libself-olm libself-omemo Mac (m1/arm64) Brew on M1 macs currently lacks environment variables needed for the sdk to find the olm and omemo libraries, so you will need to add some additional configuration to your system:\nIn your ~/.zshrc, add:\nexport C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include/ export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/homebrew/lib You should then be able to run:\n$ source ~/.zshrc $ brew tap joinself/crypto $ brew install --build-from-source libself-olm libself-omemo Note, you may also need to create /usr/local/lib if it does not exist:\n$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib Setting up Quickstart # Note: If on Windows, run # git clone -c core.symlinks=true \\ # https://github.com/joinself/self-ruby-sdk.git # instead, to ensure correct symlink behavior $ git clone https://github.com/joinself/self-ruby-sdk.git $ cd self-ruby-sdk # Copy the ./examples/.env.example file to ./examples/.env, then fill out SELF_APP_ID # and SELF_APP_DEVICE_SECRET in .env $ cp ./examples/.env.example ./examples/.env # start the container $ ./demo up # Finally run the quick start demo $ ./demo run Use the powershell script ./demo.ps1 instead of demo if you&rsquo;re running Windows.\nPlaying with the examples When you run the demo script for the first time, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a tty interface where you&rsquo;ll be able to test all the examples.\nNote you can modify any examples under the examples.\nThe script will be displaying you information about each of the features you&rsquo;re running and pointing you to the specific documentation on this site.\n</p>",url:"https://docs.joinself.com/quickstart/"},{value:"SDK Reference",label:`<p>Self SDKs are divided on different services, each service matches one of the products Self is offering.
